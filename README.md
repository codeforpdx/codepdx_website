# Welcome to the readme for the CODE PDX website.

Welcome! 👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼

🚧UNDER CONSTRUCTION!🚧

We are currently structuring the code pdx website repo. Detailed information for those looking to contribute can be found in [contributing.md](./contributing.md). We are in the process of structuring out the build and creating issues for tasks. 

**to run dev environment:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**to run production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

<!-- setup and add scripts for es lint and prettier -->

**to run ESLint:**
```bash

```

**to run prettier:**
```bash

```

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

**we are using vite plugin:**
 - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<!-- 
    we aren't using this right now
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
